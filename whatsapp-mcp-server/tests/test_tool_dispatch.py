"""Invoke read-only tools through the real MCP dispatch layer.

The rest of the suite asserts tool *registration* (names, annotations) but never
calls a tool the way a client does. That gap let four core tools ship returning
dataclasses against a `dict` schema — registration was fine, every real call
raised a validation error. These tests call through `mcp.call_tool`, which runs
the same structured-output validation an MCP client triggers, so a return-shape
regression fails here instead of in production.
